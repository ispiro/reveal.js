                    <p class="prose">I built <a href="http://www.fastfoodmaps.com" target="_blank">Fast Food Maps</a> with <b>PHP</b>, <b>JavaScript</b> and the <b>Google Maps API</b>. I scraped and geocoded fifty-thousand locations from public websites with <b>shell</b> scripts. This was the first Maps mashup that could handle so many data points. The site appeared in Wired Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, and the MoMA exhibit <i>Design and the Elastic Mind</i>.</p>

                    <p class="prose">The Maps API could not handle more than a few hundred markers at a time, a limitation I overcame by aggregating points based on zoom level and by only drawing markers that appear in the current view. As the user drags, new location data is seamlessly downloaded and rendered.</p>
