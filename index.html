                    Houndbite is a podcasting site based on audience-submitted content. I consulted on the concept and design and did the entire build. This included a Flash audio player, user registration, voting, integration of a Java recording applet, a store, administrative tools for maintaining the site.

                    I used <b>Flash</b> to create an experimental genre that combined humor and games.
